// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


Part 1:
PRINT "Enter the first number:"
READ num1

PRINT "Enter the second number:"
READ num2

sum = num1 + num2

PRINT "The sum of the two numbers is:", sum



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Part 2:
PRINT "Enter a number:"
READ number

IF number % 2 == 0 THEN:
    PRINT "The number is even."
ELSE:
    PRINT "The number is odd."

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Part 3:
numbers = []

FOR i from 1 to 5 DO:
    PRINT "Enter number", i, ":"
    READ num
    numbers.append(num)

sum = 0
FOR num in numbers:
    sum = sum + num

average = sum / 5

min = numbers[0]  
max = numbers[0]   

FOR num in numbers:
    IF num < min THEN:
        min = num
    IF num > max THEN:
        max = num

PRINT "The average of the five numbers is:", average
PRINT "The smallest number is:", min
PRINT "The largest number is:", max
